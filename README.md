## Extending Wisej

Wisej was designed to be extensible and open to all sorts of technologies from the start. The extensions published are a fraction of what is possible and what will be available during the product’s lifetime.

Note that most published extensions are also already precompiled and included in the installer and are automatically added to Visual Studio’s toolbox.
